Part 1 covers how images are stored in code.\
Part 2 introduces some image processing methods in a Processor Template.\
Part 3 uses inheritance to simulate a monetized app.\
Part 4 uses inheritance to simulate a premium app with new methods.\ 
Part 5 implements a KNN classifier to predict the labels of images.
